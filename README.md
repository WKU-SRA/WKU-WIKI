# WKU-SRA-WIKI

Hi, WKU-SRA-WIKI is a vault of knowledge, especially research information, philosophy, and learning for students at WKU. It was developed, maintained, and deployed by the members of the WKU-SRA. It's more than just a research manual; it's a living and collective wisdom and passion of its creators.

The primary content of our website is currently in Chinese. Because Wenzhou-Kean University (WKU) is a Sino-US joint school. We are considering the possibility of offering an English version of our website. Should you be interested in contributing to such a translation effort, your assistance would be greatly appreciated.
